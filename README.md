# DifferentialEvolution

This is a pure C code of differential evolution. The usage of the code can be found in the *test* folder.

A very explanatory document about the alogrithm can be found from a blog written by Pablo R. Mier: [A tutorial on Differential Evolution with Python](https://pablormier.github.io/2017/09/05/a-tutorial-on-differential-evolution-with-python/).
